this is the deKorator kwin deco,
deKorator is based on the HOWTO: KWin Window Manager Decorations posted in here: http://kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=6332
and done by Brandybuck, 10x david:)
the man that responsiable for all the art design is jon clarke AKA ArbitraryReason.
the nice thing about deKorator is that it loads the images from
some user defined directory(something quiet similar to what iceWM is doing ),
thats means that everything is themeable with no time and no programming knowledge is needed.
one thing to note is that if u would like to see the changes instantly when designing the tiles, u need to run "kwin --replace&".
